        "description": "ChatGPT Bot",
        "background_color": "#590088"
    },
    "features": {
        "bot_user": {
            "display_name": "ChatGPTBot",
            "always_online": true
        }
    },
    "oauth_config": {
        "scopes": {
            "bot": [
                "app_mentions:read",
                "channels:history",
                "chat:write",
                "im:read",
                "im:history",
                "assistant:write"
            ]

    },
    "settings": {
        "event_subscriptions": {
            "request_url": "https://chatgptbot.yourserver.com/events",
            "bot_events": [
                "app_mention",
                "message.im"
            ]
